problem statement : 
	Scan a database, find a document missing for opening an account for example,
	then reach out to the customer saying we are missing your Government Id, 
	wait for it to be sent, potentially using OCR identify if it's the right document or not, 
	and trigger the following action
	
step0:create user folder with his/her first name last name and dob
step1: Import user gov document such as aadhar or PAN card in image or pdf format

step2: extract user required information from image and pdf data using OCR Tesserct ,Opencv 

step3: create a code to organize the user info in perticular format ie first name ,last name, DOB, Address for each document.
		for each document create seperate python file. 
		
step4:create dataframe/dimension tables for each gov document with all the essential columns and 
       write that dataframe/dimension tables into excel/postgress/txt etc

step5: once we have all the dimension tables for each gov document, create a fact table which will have user information 
       from all the dimension table.
	   
	   first create unique id column combining fistname lastname dob columns. eg:: jemsbond01012000
	   
	   check the unique column in all dimension tables and join all the tables with unique id, useing sequence matcher and fuzzy logic.
	   
	   then you will get final table with data from all the dimentional tables in one table, call it as fact table/final dataframe.
	   
	   create flag for each document column, if any document for that user is not present then assign 1 value else 0.
	   
step6: send the email to the user where flag value is 1 and request the perticular document.
